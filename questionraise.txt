First of all make it clear that, you ask the following questions.


1. Is the job contract to hire?
2. What is the companys exact location?
3. Do i have to work in shift?
4. If it is a shift, whether they provide cab or not.
If they provide the answers you expect. Then tell them, okay i can take the interview.
Ask them to conduct a telephonic interview for the first round.
This will save your travel time and will build confidence in you for next interviews
