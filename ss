i got sir
there are other variations missing too
how are you applying logic, is there a library for it?

because, if the number of keywords increases, then the combination also increases

haaaa iam using permutation and combination 
is there a library for mashing up variations?
haaaa
combination
ok

we used to use this when we were in school
3c3 = 9 variations

remember?
yes
ok

so let's get all possible variations together and then we can test for availability
okay

use the worst case scenario as 10 keywords
okay
lemme know when it is ready for testing
okau

and also
can you clean up the results for availability status?
basically, there are 2 major statuses: 
1. Registered 
2. Not Registered (available)

yes

so column #1 = Domain Name
column #2 - Registered or Unregistered
column #3 - If registered, owner information via whois data

okay
